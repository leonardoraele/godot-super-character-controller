	/// changes their velocity. If this happens, this acceleration will be applied every physics tick until the
	/// character's speed is reduced to be within it's max speed range.
	/// Set this propery to 0 to allow the player to maintain any momentum they build indefinitely, until they release
	/// the directional input.

	/// apply, so the player can decelerate faster by entering the opposite directional input.
